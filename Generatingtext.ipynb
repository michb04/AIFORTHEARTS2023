    "## Context and Task Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are working with a generative AI model to produce text in the style of William Shakespeare. The primary tasks are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Explore the Data**: Retrieve and inspect Shakespeare's text dataset.\n",
    "2. **Prepare the Data**: Process the text data for use in a machine learning model.\n",
    "3. **Build and Train the Model**: Create a neural network to learn from the text data and generate new text.\n",
    "4. **Generate Text**: Use the trained model to generate text based on a seed input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we download and read Shakespeare's text from a URL. This step ensures we have the necessary data for training our model. Printing the first 80 characters helps us verify that the data is loaded correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We use TensorFlow's `TextVectorisation` layer to tokenize the text by individual characters. The layer is adapted to our dataset, converting the text into numerical values. We then subtract 2 from these values to exclude special tokens (padding and unknown). The number of unique tokens and the total dataset size are printed to understand the scale of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the Data for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the `to_dataset` function to convert our sequence of encoded text into a TensorFlow dataset. This function creates overlapping windows of text data, which are then used to train the model. We prepare separate datasets for training, validation, and testing, ensuring we have a robust setup for model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building and Training the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we define and compile a Sequential model with an embedding layer, a GRU layer, and a dense output layer. This model is trained on our prepared datasets. We use the `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save the best-performing model based on validation accuracy. Training the model helps it learn patterns in Shakespeare's writing, enabling it to generate similar text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a new model that includes both the text vectorization layer and the trained text generation model. This combined model is used to predict the next character in a sequence and to extend a given seed text. The `next_char` and `extend_text` functions control how text is generated, with the `temperature` parameter adjusting the creativity of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of the generative AI model, consider the coherence and stylistic fidelity of the generated text. Examine whether the output resembles Shakespearean language and whether it maintains logical continuity. Testing with various seed texts and temperature settings will provide insights into the model's versatility and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the Code to Own Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types of Data**: The code could be adapted to generate text from other literary genres, historical documents, or even modern dialogues.\n",
    "- **Interest and Application**: Exploring different types of text can demonstrate the model's ability to handle diverse styles and content, providing insights into its adaptability.\n",
    "- **Data Transformation**: Different types of data would need to be preprocessed similarly, including tokenization and encoding, to be compatible with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating text that mimics specific authors or styles raises ethical issues related to authorship and intellectual property. It's crucial to consider the potential misuse of generated content and to ensure transparency about the model's capabilities and limitations. Addressing these concerns helps in responsible AI development and usage.\n"
